I had the chance to do DevOps work and experience the whole product lifecycle from design, implementation, to testing and installation on customer sites. During my time I was responsible for several components with diverse technology stacks, including Wildfly and Tomcat both as standalone and clustered servers, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL and Elasticsearch as data stores and search engines, Kafka/Zookeeper and ActiveMQ as queue systems and extensive GNU/Linux administration and installation. Furthermore I dabbled to a lesser extent in technologies such as Keycloak and Kerberos authentication, continous integration using Jenkins, Nagios for health status monitoring and Vagrant for automatic development setups."
